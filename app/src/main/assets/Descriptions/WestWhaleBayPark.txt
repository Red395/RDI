Whale Bay Road, Southampton
Whale Bay Fort and the Battery were used to protect the entrance to Hogfish Cut, a narrow channel for small boats leading to the Royal Naval Dockyard. The channel could potentially be used by the enemy to get into the land area and attack the Dockyard. The semi-circular fort is on a spectacular setting. It overlooks the West Whale Bay Beach and you get a sweeping view of the south coast from here. Originally the battery was mounted with three 9-inch canons weighing 12 tons each. They we removed around 1897 and replaced with three 4.7 inch Quick Firing guns that could target boats about 6 miles (11,000 yards) away in the sea. However those guns were also dismantled after the first world war.
