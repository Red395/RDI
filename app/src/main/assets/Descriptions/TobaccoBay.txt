St. Georges, Bermuda
Tobacco Bay beach is located in Bermuda's St. George's parish and is one of the most popular beaches in the island. Locals say that the beach was so named because tobacco was found growing here many years back. This beach is one of our all time favorites for snorkeling. The water here is quite shallow and you get a fascinating view of the colorful marine life along with corals. However, this is not a pink sandy beach like the ones in south shore. The sand here is normal pale yellow in color. If you can time it right when the wind is from the south, you'll find some of the most sheltered spots in the beach with shallow waters, and ideal for snorkeling. Columns of limestone rocks of 15 to 25 feet high separate the bay from the open ocean. Near the rocks the water depth averages about 10 feet. If you swim through the rocks out into the open ocean, the water depth increases very fast and the water becomes murky due to silt. I won't advise you to do that. Some tourists have fun by diving off the rocks. I heard one saying that the view is awesome from the top of the rocks. But it's risky and certainly not for all.
