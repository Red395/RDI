South Rd, Bermuda
Located in Smith's Parish, Spittal Pond is a 64-arce area of land that is the largest and most premium nature reserve on the Island. In the middle of the park is an 8-acre spittal pond...hence the name. There is a winding trail that will take you to breathtaking views of South Shore. Along the way you’ll see many different types of wildlife and come across ‘Spanish Rock’. This is a historic rock that has now been casted in bronze, which contains the letters ‘RP’. This is believed to stand for Rex Portugaliae referring to Portugal’s Kind in 1543. It’s also believed that portugueses sailors from a wrecked ship carved this into the rock.
