South-Eastern end, St. Davids
Coopers Island is part of St. Davids of Bermuda located at the south eastern end and covering an area of about 44.5 acres. Coopers island was occupied by the U.S military, and later U.S Navy. A NASA space tracking station was also located here. The island was a restricted area until 1995. The island was likely named after William Cooper from London who was the member of Somers Isle Company that initially took up the administration of Bermuda during the British colonization. In 1614, Governor Moore had built the Pembroke Fort at the south eastern end of Coopers island. It had two cannons mounted on it. The fort was destroyed during the World War II. In 1960, NASA had built a space tracking station at the Coopers Island to gather tracking and scientific data from all its spacecraft, satellites and planetary probes. However, by 1995 the entire base was closed down by U.S and the island was opened out to public.
