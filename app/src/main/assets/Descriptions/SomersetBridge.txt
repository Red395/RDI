Worlds smallest drawbridge
Somerset Bridge is located at the western part of Bermuda in Sandys parish. It actually connects the main island with Somerset island. This is the world's smallest drawbridge. Which means that it opens up from the middle allowing the ships to pass by. Somerset bridge was originally constructed way back in 1620. In those days, whenever a small ship required to pass through, the bridge used to be opened using a manual crankshaft. In 20th century, Somerset bridge went through some major renovation, but much of it's basic constructs have been retained even now.
