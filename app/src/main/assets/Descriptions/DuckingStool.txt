St. Georges, Bermuda
Kings square is the main town center of St. George's, and is also known as the Town Square. This is an open space  and venue of many annual events and ceremonies. The square was created only in 19th century by filling up a marshy part of St. George's harbor. Just outside the building, you will see replica of the Stocks and Pillory. These were used during the British colonial days of 18th century for punishing those who committed petty crimes like drunkenness. You will also see whipping posts. At the eastern side of Kings square is the Town Hall which dates from 1782. Here you can know about the past Mayors of the town of St. George and see their portraits. The civic government still meets here. At the waterfront there is a replica Ducking Stool which is used to reenact the colonial history by ducking a woman into the water who plays the role of a nagging wench. This was a way of punishment used in the early days particularly for nagging and gossiping women.
