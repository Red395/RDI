20 Heydon Dr Sandys
This beautiful property in western Sandys parish is a private park administered by the Heydon Trust. This 43 acres of lush gardens is one of the largest parks in Bermuda and also has 10 old buildings in it. There is also a chapel called Heydon Chapel inside the park. This is the smallest church in Bermuda built in 1620 and offers nondenominational services. The name of the Park came from Jeremy Heydon, an investor in the Bermuda Company that used to run the governance of Bermuda in the early 17th century. Heydon was a puritan and quite unpopular. He had however set up the Heydon Trust. The Trust administers and owns the houses, property and the land.
