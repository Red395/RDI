Govnt.Hill Rd, St.Georges
Located in St. George's parish, Somers Garden has been named after Admiral Sir George Somers who is considered to be the founder of Bermuda. In 1609 his flagship that was bound for Virginia, got wrecked on a reef near St. George. It was in recognition of his efforts, the island was initially given a name Somers Isle, which still continues to be an alternative name for Bermuda. After reaching the Jamestown in Virginia, Somers found that those who had earlier reached the new British colony were starving for days and most were already dead. He decided to return to Bermuda to collect provisions. However, on his return he fell ill and finally died. His final wish was that his body be buried in Bermuda. His nephew Matthew Somers partially honored his wish and buried his heart at the south west corner of the garden which is now known as the Somers Garden. However, Matthew took the body back to England.
