St. Georges, Bermuda
Located at the northern tip of St Georges and overlooking the ocean, St Catherine fort stands between the St Catherine Beach on one side and Achilles Bay on the other side. One of the most impressive forts in the island. This fort has many historic exhibits, artifacts, and a well preserved interior. Surrounded by a dry moat and accessed by a drawbridge, the fort has a large number of tunnels, towers, redoubts and ramparts. In 1609, the ship Sea Venture of Sir George Somers was wrecked on a reef nearby. The entire crew came ashore where the St. Catherine fort now stands. They actually started the first settlement in Bermuda.
