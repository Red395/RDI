Maritime Lane
Located at the premises of National Museum of Bermuda at Dockyard, Commissioner's House once used to be the home of the Dockyard Commissioner and thus the name. This is a grand Georgian House built in 1820s and the first ever cast iron house in the world. In fact the frame of the building was cast in England and then brought to Bermuda. The commissioner who was the overall in-charge of the dockyard, used to live in this building between 1827 - 1837. After that, the building was taken over by the British army.
