68 Spanish Point Rd, Pembroke
Admiralty House is located about just outside city of hamilton in an area known as Spanish Point. The property was gifted to the British Royal Navy from the Bermuda Government. A state house was built to house the Navy’s admirals who were posted at nearby docks. The building was knocked down and all that remains is the ruins of the ball room. There are also underground tunnels built by the military that joined caves that led toward the seaside. Today admiralty house is used as park, beach, and a place for locals to go cliff jumping.
