106 Middle Rd, Devonshire
As the name suggests, this is a very old church. The original version of the church that was surrounded by palm trees, was built in the year 1624. It was a true reflection of original Bermudian architecture. However in 1715, the church was completely destroyed by hurricane. It was reconstructed as a replica of the original one in 1716. In 1970, the church was burnt down completely by an arsonist. Later it was restored again retaining its original design and form. The church, made of limestone and wood is really small and looks like a cottage. As you see the interior, you will realize that ship construction skill of those days were used to construct the church. This suggests that workers who were in ship construction industry were also engaged in buildings churches
