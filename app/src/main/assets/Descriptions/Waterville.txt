Pomander Road, Paget
Located on the waters edge at the end of Hamilton Harbour, known as the Foot of the Lane, Waterville is the headquarters of the Bermuda National Trust. This elegant house was built in 1725 by the Trimingham family, and was the site of the first Triminghams store, which opened in 1842. The reception rooms provide an interesting look into life in early Bermuda. The charming grounds include the Bermuda Rose Societys showcase garden of old roses and the Mary-Jean Mitchell Green Memorial Garden and Gazebo.
