11 Queen St, Hamilton
Perot Post Office is named after William B. Perot Bermuda’s first Postmaster General in 1821. In 1848 Perot produced his own postage stamps making Bermuda only the second British Colony to have its own postage stamps. Only 11 exist today. The stamps are very rare and expensive, the most recent auctioned for $92,000 in 1985.
