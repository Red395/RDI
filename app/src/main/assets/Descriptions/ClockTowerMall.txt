6 Clock Tower Parade
Located at the Royal Naval Dockyard, it's hard to miss this impressive building with its twin clock towers. The two towers on the two sides of the building are 100-foot high, one having a clock that shows the real time and the other with a clock that shows the time of the high tide. The Clocktower building was built in 1850s as a warehouse for the British Navy which once had an active operation at the dockyard. The walls of the building are some 3-foot thick. Today it's a major shopping mall at the western part of Bermuda.
