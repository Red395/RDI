Evans Bay Rd, Southhampton
It's a nice nature reserve covering an area of 7.5 acres and located at the Scroggins Hill. While the access is from Evan's bay road (off Middle road) and is not easy, there are lot of endemic plants and wildlife that can be seen here including birds. The salt water pond is surrounded by mangroves and woodland area. You can see Bermuda cedars, giant toads, herons, lizards, sponges etc in the reserve.
