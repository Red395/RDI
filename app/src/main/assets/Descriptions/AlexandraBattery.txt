St. Georges, Bermuda
Located at the eastern edge of Bermuda in St. George's, Alexandra Battery is a fortification made in the 1860s. Just below the fort, there is a small beach which is well known in Bermuda for colorful sea glass. This beach is known as Building Bay Beach. First about the fort. It was named after the princess of Denmark Alexandra. She was married to Edward VII who later became the king of Great Britain. The fort was built on a site where there was another old battery called Buildings Bay Battery which was built in 1840s. Like several other forts, this one too was built to guard the eastern waterways. In early 1900s, when the princess of Denmark Alexandra became the Queen, the entire fort was modernized and equipped with two 6-inch modern guns for coastline protections. These guns were called the Rifled Breech Loaders. The beach is so named because this is where the building of the ship Deliverance took place in 1610 after the original ship of Sir George Somers got wrecked at a nearby reef.
