Somerset Village
Fort Scaur is located at the western end of Bermuda in Somerset and on the highest hill top. This fort was built in 1870s at the time when the relationship between British and the Americans were strained. The fort was built in such a way that it was barely visible from the sea. The idea was to save the Royal Naval Dockyard, the largest naval dockyard in Bermuda and protect it from any possible land attacks. This was the time when the British thought that the Americans may try to seize the Dockyard and use it as their port. It's an inland fort that was built to defend any land based attacks from the south shore.
