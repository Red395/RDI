St. Davids, Bermuda
St. David's Battery also known as the Great Head Battery, is located at the easternmost point of St George's parish in St. David's Island. This battery was built in 1910 and has a wonderful park associated with it called the Great Head Park. The entire area spans across some 24 aces. The battery that went through several transformations from a small gun platform to a formidable fort was built to defend the Narrows Channel that leads to the St. George's Harbor.
