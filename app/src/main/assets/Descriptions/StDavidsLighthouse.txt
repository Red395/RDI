St. Davids, Bermuda
The lighthouse is located at St. Davids of St. George's Parish. The original town here grew up around the British military base built to protect the southern entrance of St George's Harbor. The town is still in protection business, but today it looks out for the ships that pass through the waters around Bermuda. St Davids Lighthouse stands on the highest point on the Eastern tip of the island standing on 208 feet above the sea level. It sends its beam 20 miles over the ocean. It was built on a hill top and not on the coastline to ensure longest visibility. It was built in 1879 mainly to provide signals to the ships so that they didn't come too close to the hidden reefs in the water. It still serves as a beacon for the mariners. The construction of the lighthouse had an interesting background.
