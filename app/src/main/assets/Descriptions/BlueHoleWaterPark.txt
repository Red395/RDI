This nature reserve was named after an Irish poet who used to come here to write some of his poems way back in 1844. It consists of forest trails and covert caves. Stalactites can be found in these. Some of the caves found here are called Blue Grotto, Castle Grotto, Causeway Cave, Deep Blue, Fern Sink, Subway Cave, Vine, and Walsingham Cave. Although many are them are really small, some of them are nice for swimming. One can find a variety of bird species here, such as cardinals, doves, finches, herons, etc. There is a mangrove pond located at this landmark. It is pretty deep and has crystal clear blue water. This is considered the "Blue Hole". Here, one can find a variety of different kinds of fish and turtles too.
