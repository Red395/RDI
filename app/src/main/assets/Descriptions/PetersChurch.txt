Queen St, St Georges
Located in the historic town of St George, St Peter's Church is believed to be the oldest continually used Anglican church in the Western hemisphere. The church was not however the first house of worship to stand on this site. It replaced a 1612 structure made of wooden posts and palmetto leaves that was destroyed in a storm. The church has many treasures. Inside you will see the altar from the original structure. It was built in 1615 under the supervision of Bermuda's first governor, Richard Moore. This is the oldest piece of woodwork in Bermuda. The font of St. Peter's church is over 500 years old and was brought to Bermuda by the first settlers. The late 18th-century bishop's throne is believed to have been salvaged from a shipwreck. There's also a fine collection of communion silver from the 1600s in the vestry. As you walk outside to the churchyard, you can see two graveyards. A walled area to the west of the church was for black slaves. The one on the east was reserved for whites. St. Peter's Church is an important site on the African Diaspora Heritage Trail of Bermuda that traces the legacy of Bermuda's slavery.
