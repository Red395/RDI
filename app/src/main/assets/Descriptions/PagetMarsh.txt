Valley Rd, Paget
This 25 acres of marshy land in Paget with plethora of lush greenery and vegetation is a nature reserve and maintained jointly by Bermuda National Trust and Bermuda Audubon Society. The marsh has a peat. The water areas, mangroves, grassy lands and of course the forests have all made it attractive for the nature lovers. A 400-ft boardwalk has been built through the marsh that allows the visitors to take close look at the various flora and fauna. Although a short walk, the boardwalk goes up to the other end of the Marsh.
