Blockade Alley, St Georges
As the name suggests, it's an incomplete church. Its picturesque Gothic ruins is an important landmark in St. George's. The construction work began in the year 1874 when St Peter's Church was badly damaged by a storm and was thought to be beyond repair. So a new church had to be built to replace St. Peter's.One of the main reasons that the church remained unfinished was strong difference in opinion within the parishioners. A local population felt that they would rather invest the money in repairing the old church instead of building a new one. Another faction separated out and built a different church close by known as the Reformed Episcopal Church which is now under the Salvation Army.
