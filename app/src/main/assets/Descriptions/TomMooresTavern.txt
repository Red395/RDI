7 Walsingham Lane, Hamilton
Tom Moore's Tavern was first built as a private home in 1652 and within the last 100 years has turned into a restaurant. It is the oldest restaurant in Bermuda. They are known to specialize in seafood. The property was originally owned by Robert Walsingham – he was in charge of the Sea Venture ship that brought the first settlers to the island of Bermuda. Since it was first built as a house there are several rooms which are used as dining rooms. The walls are covered in darkened cedar walls. There are four fireplaces located at this restaurant. There is an outside patio that is also used as a dining area for guests, but it is mainly used for private functions allowing accommodations of 100 guests.
