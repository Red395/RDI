St. Georges, Bermuda
Gates Fort was built around 1612. It sits right on the edge of Town Cut, a channel that was created for ships to enter the St. George Harbor. Gates fort with its great vantage point overlooking the Town Cut, was built to stop any suspect or enemy boats to enter the St. George Harbor from the open sea. It was named after Thomas Gates, the Governor elect of Jamestown Virginia. In 1609, Thomas Gates was also in the same ship Sea Venture along with Somers and his men, that got wrecked near St. George. He governed Bermuda between 1609 to 1610, and later became the Governor of Jamestown, Virginia.
