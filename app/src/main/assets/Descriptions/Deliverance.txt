Kings Square, St Georges
You will find a full size replica of the ship Deliverance in St. George's Bermuda. Admiral Sir George Somers and his men were stranded at Bermuda after their ship Sea Venture strayed in a severe storm and got wrecked at a reef near St. Georges in 1609. They were in a fleet of nine ships that started from Plymouth of England heading towards Jamestown to create a new British settlement. But their ill fate separated them from rest of the fleet and stranded them in Bermuda. Strangely all 150 on board were alive even after Sea Venture crashed against a reef and they all came on shore at the St. George's area. Over the next nine months Somers' men built two ships, Deliverance and the Patience to complete their journey to Jamestown. Salvaged remains of the ship Sea Venture and Bermuda cedar were mostly used to build the two ships. Finally on May 10, 1610, Somers and his men started their journey once again for Jamestown.
