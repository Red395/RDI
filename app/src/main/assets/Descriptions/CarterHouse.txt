Carter House is one of the oldest homes in Bermuda located at St. Davids and built in 1640 by the descendants of Christopher Carter. Sir George Somers and his men started the British colonization in Bermuda in 1609 when their ship got wrecked nearby and they all came ashore. When Somers started his sail towards Jamestown from Bermuda, he asked three men to stay back to continue the British claim of Bermuda. Carter was one of those who stayed back. He along with the other two found huge amount of Ambergris on the shore. When the three men found such huge quantity of Ambergris that were washed up the shore, they decided to smuggle it out to England. However on the final day when they all got into the boat, Carter lost confidence and instead handed over his two mates to Governor of Bermuda blaming it entirely on them. So Carter became a free man and finally settled in Coopers Island in St. David's. His descendants later built this house.
