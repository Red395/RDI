Middle Rd, Southhampton 
Vesey Nature Reserve is a 7.98-acre nature reserve saved for the people of Bermuda in 2008 when Sharon Vesey generously gave the property to the Bermuda National Trust and the Bermuda Audubon Society jointly. Stretching from Middle Road to the waters of the Little Sound, it supports a diverse range of ecological habitats which include a rocky shoreline, coastal scrubland, forests and a tidal salt pond, Evans Pond, which is surrounded by lush dense mangroves. Toward the south end of the reserve there are stunning abandoned quarries and agricultural fields. Plans are underway to make the site publically accessible through the creation of nature trails and the installation of educational signage.
