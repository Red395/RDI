King Street, Hamilton
Fort Hamilton is located on the outskirts of the City of Hamilton and was built in the 1870s to protect the Hamilton Harbour. Unfortunately the fort lost its significance before it was even constructed and became a garbage dumping ground. George Ogden, Park Superintendent, later turned the sight into a garden and is now managed by the Corporation of Hamilton.
