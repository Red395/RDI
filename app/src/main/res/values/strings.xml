    <string name="contact_us_overview">The 2018 TLF students created this app to give people something else to do during their time in Bermuda.
                                        \n\nThe Round D Island application has been designed for the use of tourists and locals to allow them to
                                        explore and learn about landmarks in Bermuda. Currently the app is only for the use of android devices.
                                        Individuals will be allowed to download the app from our website which will allow them to explore and learn
                                        about significant Bermudian landmarks.
                                        \n\nThe TLF program is an intensive 12-week summer internship where IT college students acquire experience
                                        in the ICT industry through classroom learning, team projects, fieldwork.
